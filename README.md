# Connect-Four-Console-App
A connect four game in C++ made in Visual Studio.

Was made for a class assignment and can be played with 2 people or with an AI that randomly chooses their move.

The prints forming the board was provided by teacher, but all the functionality is by me.

Download the .zip file for the exe, or all the files to edit and play with the code.
